Here I keep my dotfiles. I manage them using org-mode. This files are
not deployed using symlinks, they need to be tangled from the
respective org file. For an introduction to how to manage dotfiles
with org-mode see [[https://expoundite.net/guides/dotfile-management][Dotfile Management and Documentation with Org-Mode]].
