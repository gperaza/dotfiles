Here I keep my dotfiles. I manage them using org-mode. This files are
not deployed using symlinks, they need to be tangled from the
respective org file. For an introduction to how to manage dotfiles
with org-mode see [[https://expoundite.net/guides/dotfile-management][Dotfile Management and Documentation with Org-Mode]].

Dotfile list:
 - Emacs init.el: Tangle emacs-config.org.

I also keep a set of useful bash scripts in the script
directory. Remember to keep script in the PATH.
Script list:
 - gp2eps: generate an eps figure from a gnuplot file in color
 - gp2psbw: generate an eps figure from a gnuplot file in black and white
 - ctex: clean latex temporary files
